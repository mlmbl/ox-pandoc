#+TITLE: ox-pandoc: an exporter for Org Mode using pandoc

=ox-pandoc= is an 
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html#Exporting][exporter]] for
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] which converts Org-mode files to a
wide variety of other formats using the [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]]
tool. Pandoc can produce PDFs, HTML, presentations, markdown files,
office documents and e-pub publications as well as a number of other
more specialised formats.

* Installation
** Requirements
You need Emacs 24.4, org-mode 8.2, and Pandoc 2.0 (or later versions).

Note that the support for [[*Citations and Bibliographies (Experimental)][citations]] in newest versions of org-mode
(9.5+) require a similarly recent version of Pandoc (2.17+).

** Installing Pandoc
Installing Pandoc directly from
[[https://pandoc.org/installing.html][the official website]] is
recommended. The versions of Pandoc provided by package managers and
distributions is often quite out-of-date.

By default, =ox-pandoc= will check on starting up whether there is a
suitable pandoc executable available. When none is found, or the version
is too old, a warning will be emitted. This warning can be suppressed
by setting customisation option =org-pandoc-check-version= to =nil=.

** Installation
You can install this tool with [[https://www.melpa.org][MELPA]].  For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq package-archives
      '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
        ("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")))
#+END_SRC

: M-x package-install ⏎
: ox-pandoc ⏎

* Usage
** Using Org's export-dispatch menu
   As always in Org, =C-c C-e= brings up the export dispatch menu for
   the current org-mode file. =ox-pandoc= lives under the =p= key. By
   default, options are offered to convert the org-file to a number of
   commonly used and generic formats, such as LaTeX, PDF, HTML, markdown
   and word-processor files.

   Pandoc and =ox-pandoc= support a very large number of [[*Supported Formats][output formats]].
   To avoid cluttering Org's export menu, most formats are not shown by
   default. For example, most application-specific formats, markdown
   dialects and slides are not included. You can customize the
   =org-pandoc-menu-entry= variable (and probably restart Emacs) to
   change the menu entries to include those you commonly use. A full
   list of exporting commands and suggested shortcuts can be found in
   =ox-pandoc.el=.

** Running the Commands directly

The exporters can be called directly via =M-x=. For example, to convert
org-mode file to 'html5' format, you may run the following commands:

- =org-pandoc-export-as-html5= :: Exports to the HTML5 text as a buffer.
- =org-pandoc-export-to-html5= :: Exports to the HTML5 text file.
- =org-pandoc-export-to-html5-and-open= :: Exports and open HTML5 file.

All of the formats supported by =ox-pandoc= have corresponding commands
named in this way. =org-pandoc-export-as-[FORMAT]= exports to a buffer
and =org-pandoc-export-to-[FORMAT]= exports to a file. Note that some
formats (e.g. PDF) can only be exported to a file, not to a buffer.

The opening of exported files in the =XXX-and-open= variants is handled
by =org-open-file=. Which applications are used for different file types
can be customised in Org Mode by the =org-file-apps= variable.

* Document options
** Passing options to pandoc
The =pandoc= command supports a
[[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#options][large number of options]]
which can be used to control how the document is processed and how the
output should appear. In =ox-pandoc= these options can be specified for
individual documents or [[#setting-default-pandoc-options][set as
defaults for specific formats]].

The following document-specific options can be specified. Value =nil=
overrides preceding option setting. Value =t= means only specify
option, but not its value. Options are delimited by space.
=#+PANDOC_OPTIONS:= can be specified multiple times. If you want to
specify the option value which include space character, the /entire/
option-value pair must be quoted (see example below).

- =PANDOC_OPTIONS:= :: Add command line options to the Pandoc process.
- =PANDOC_METADATA:= :: Metadata for Pandoc.
- =PANDOC_EXTENSIONS:= :: Extensions for specific Pandoc output.
- =PANDOC_VARIABLES:= :: Variables for Pandoc.
- =EPUB_RIGHTS:= :: copyright info to be embedded to EPUB metadata.
- =EPUB_CHAPTER_LEVEL:= :: same as 'epub-chapter-level' pandoc-option.
- =EPUB_STYLESHEET:= :: same as 'epub-stylesheet' pandoc-option.
- =EPUB_COVER:= :: same as 'epub-cover-image' pandoc-option.
- =EPUB_FONT:= :: same as 'epub-embed-font' pandoc-option. Only one
                  font can be specified in each line. Multiple fonts
                  can be specified by repeatedly use this option.
- =EPUB_META:= :: put contents into a temporary file and specify
                  that file to 'epub-metadata' option.
- =EPUB_CSS:= :: put contents into a temporary file and specify
                 that file to 'epub-stylesheet' option.
- =BIBLIOGRAPHY:= :: same as 'bibliography' pandoc-option. Only one
     bibliography can be specified in each line. Multiple
     bibliographies can be specified by repeatedly use this option.

Following is an example:

: #+PANDOC_OPTIONS: standalone:t pdf-engine:pdflatex
: ## When option value includes whitespace, entire name:value pair must be quoted.
: #+PANDOC_OPTIONS: "epub-cover-image:/home/a/test file.png" standalone:nil
: #+PANDOC_OPTIONS: number-sections:nil
: #+PANDOC_OPTIONS: template:mytemplate.tex
: #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: sample.bib
: # Specifying Multiple values to single options by using colon-sparated lists.
: #+PANDOC_OPTIONS: filter:pandoc-zotxt:pandoc-citeproc
: #+PANDOC_OPTIONS: csl:IEEE.csl
: #+PANDOC_EXTENSIONS: markdown-typography latex+auto_identifiers
: #+PANDOC_VARIABLES: documentclass:IEEEtran
: #+PANDOC_VARIABLES: classoption:10pt,conference
: #+PANDOC_METADATA: page-progression-direction:ltr
: #+latex_header: \author{\IEEEauthorblockN{John Smith}
: #+latex_header: \IEEEauthorblockA{FooBar Institute\\
: #+latex_header: Email: john.smith@foo.bar}

** Org-Mode export settings
Org Mode defines a considerable number of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html][Export settings]]. These control which parts of the org document are exported and how this is done. For example, they can be used to set whether a table of contents is created and whether title and author should be inserted into the output document.

Pandoc should understand and follow these directives. *HOWEVER* pandoc only operates on the file it is given and does not know about settings from Emacs such as customisations. If, for example, you wish not to have a Table of Contents, there must be a line =#+OPTIONS: toc:nil= in the file itself; any global setting of =org-export-with-toc= will not be respected.

Note that Org Mode will by default try to deduce the author's full name (using =user-full-name=) when exporting, even if it is not given in the org document. To suppress this, add =#+OPTIONS: author: nil= in the document's header.

* Customisation
** Setting default pandoc options

You can specify the default options passed to pandoc and used on its
command-line for each document format. 

- =org-pandoc-options= :: General Pandoc options.
- =org-pandoc-options-for-FORMAT= :: Format-specific options.
- =org-pandoc-epub-rights= :: EPUB Copyright Statement.

Options should be specified by an alist. List of valid options are
defined in =org-pandoc-valid-options=. Only long-name options can be
used. For example, =metadata= must be given as the option name, even
though Pandoc accepts a short-form version of the argument ("-M").
Multiple values can be specified to options defined in
=org-pandoc-colon-separated-options=. They should be defined in
colon-separated list.

Values of options defined in =org-pandoc-file-options= will be
expanded to full path if they begin with =~= (tilde) character.

You can also specify output format extension with
=org-pandoc-format-extensions= variable.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; default options for all output formats
(setq org-pandoc-options '((standalone . t)))
;; cancel above settings only for 'docx' format
(setq org-pandoc-options-for-docx '((standalone . nil)))
;; special settings for beamer-pdf and latex-pdf exporters
(setq org-pandoc-options-for-beamer-pdf '((pdf-engine . "xelatex")))
(setq org-pandoc-options-for-latex-pdf '((pdf-engine . "pdflatex")))
;; special extensions for markdown_github output
(setq org-pandoc-format-extensions '(markdown_github+pipe_tables+raw_html))
#+END_SRC

** Hooks 
Hooks are also provided to be called when =pandoc= has completed processing.

- =org-pandoc-after-processing-FORMAT-hook= :: Hook called after processing =FORMAT=. 

These hooks are only available for text-file =FORMAT=.
=after-processing= options can not be specified to =epub=, =docx= or
=pdf= formats.

For preprocessing hooks, use =org-export-before-processing-hook=.

** Delayed loading of ox-pandoc
If you want delayed loading of `ox-pandoc' when
=org-pandoc-menu-entry= is customized, please consider the following
settings in your init file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox
  (require 'ox-pandoc))
#+END_SRC

** Temporary Files
=ox-pandoc= works by first using Org-mode's own conversion functions to
export a temporary version of the org file /in org format/ and then
calling =pandoc= with the appropriate switches on this file. This
process creates temporary files in the working directory called
"XXXX.tmpZZZZ.org" and "XXXX.tmpZZZZ.css" (if necessary). (ZZZZ is a
random string)

Under normal operation the temporary files are deleted automatically
when `pandoc` has finished processing them. If you use =recentf=, you
may find these files clutter your recent files list. =M-x
recentf-cleanup= should remove them.

* Feature Support 
** Source Code Blocks
=ox-pandoc= supports the export of code blocks, including code blocks
for specific output formats (e.g. LaTeX, HTML). Code wrapped in
=#+BEGIN_EXPORT [format]= will be passed to pandoc as-is. Pandoc knows how
to handle these blocks correctly and will include them in the final
output if they match the target format. The same applies for short
format-specific snippets using Org's =@@format:= syntax.

Blocks and snippets intended only for the pandoc backend can be
specified using =#+BEGIN_EXPORT pandoc= and =@@pandoc:=. The inner
content of these blocks and snippets will be passed to pandoc. This may
be useful for adding extra information for output formats only supported
by pandoc, not by Org's own native converters.

=ox-pandoc= also supports the evaluation of embedded code blocks wrapped
with =BEGIN_SRC [language]=. The various options described by the
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html#Working-with-Source-Code][Org-mode
manual]] for working with source code should be supported: source code,
results, both or neither can included in the final document and outputs
can be specified for particular output formats (e.g. HTML).

*IMPORTANT*: if you wish to include evaluated =SRC= blocks and their
results in documents to be processed by pandoc, each block should be
given a unique name. For example.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+NAME: my--block
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports both :results value
(+ 4 7)
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Citations and Bibliographies (Experimental)
Citations can be inserted into Org documents and then, when the document
is exported and linked to a bibliography file, the citations are
formatted correctly (e.g. in footnotes, numbered or author-year style)
and a formatted bibliography added to the output document. Pandoc has
long had a [[https://pandoc.org/org.html#citations][number of options
for processing citations]] in org documents. With version 9.5
(September 2021) Org Mode added [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Citation-handling.html][official syntax and support for citations]].

=ox-pandoc= aims fully to support citation handling and export in Org Mode 9.5+ and =pandoc=. This is complicated by the many potential formats and by there being overlapping but not 100% compatible tools involved. Citation support should be seen as *experimental* and I encourage you to report unexpected results, please including sample documents.

In all cases, you can indicate what bibliography file is the source for citations in a document with a header =#+BIBLIOGRAPHY: my-references.bib=. Bibliographies can potentially be in =.bib=, =.yaml= or =.json= format. A =#+CITE_EXPORT:= header indicates how citations in the document are processed before being handed to pandoc. Which [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Citation-export-processors.html][exporter]] to choose depends on what final document format is targetted:

*** Exporting citations to LaTeX / PDF
If the document is going to be transformed to TeX and then compiled by a LaTeX processor to make (for example) a PDF, you should probably choose either the =biblatex= or =natbib= processor. Additional arguments to the header can specify the citation and bibliography format wanted from =biblatex= or =natbib= - see the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Citation-export-processors.html][Org Manual]].

In this case, =cite:= commands are replaced with the appropriate LaTeX commands. Pandoc should ignore these and pass them through to the LaTeX compiler.

*** Exporting citations to HTML, ODT, DocX etc
For other formats, the best approach at the moment is to use the =csl= Org-Mode cite processor; this requires that the =citeproc-el= Emacs package be installed. A =.csl= (Citation Style Language) file can be specified to determine how citations and bibligraphy are to be formatted.

In this case, citations and bibliography are resolved and formatted before they are passed to Pandoc, which should simply pass on the formatting to the final output document.

*** Alternative: using Pandoc citation syntax
An alternative to the above (also relevant for Org 9.4 and earlier) is to ensure that citations in text are transformed to [[https://pandoc.org/org.html#citations][one of the formats that Pandoc recognises in org documents]]. You should then set  =#+PANDOC_OPTIONS: citeproc:t= in the document header.

In this case, citations are instead processed by =pandoc= using CSL. This may be a good solution if you are using one of the alternative citation systems for Org, such as =org-ref=. A goal in =ox-pandoc= is to offer an alternative citation export processor that outputs Pandoc-specific citation syntax, but this is still in planning.

** Supported Formats

** Labelling and numbering of figures, tables etc.
Pandoc provides features for the automated numbering and referencing of
figures, tables, equations and listings through the use of add-on
filters such as [[https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos][pandoc-xnos]] and [[https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref][pandoc-crossref]]. These filters can be
installed and then enabled with =ox-pandoc= in the usual way, such as
through a document header like:
#+begin_src org
#+pandoc_options: filter:pandoc-fignos 
#+end_src
These pandoc filters rely on labelling of individual figures in your org
document with a =#+label:= attribute. This attribute is deprecated in
current Org Mode, but can still be used with ox-pandoc to tag figures
etc. that should be automatically numbered and included in lists:
#+begin_src org
#+caption: A caption for the image
#+name: fig:myimage_name
#+label: fig:myimage_label
[[file:myimage.png]]
#+end_src

* Deprecated and Removed Features
** Obsolete In-File Options
The following options were supported in previous version of =ox-pandoc=.
They are no longer supported.

- =EPUB_METADATA:= :: obsolete. Use =epub-metadata= in
     =PANDOC_OPTIONS:= instead.
- =EPUB_STYLESHEET:= :: obsolete. Use =epub-stylesheet= in
     =PANDOC_OPTIONS:= instead.

** Numbering of figures, tables and equations
=ox-pandoc= was originally developed for =pandoc= version 1. Subsequent
versions of pandoc (2.0 in 2017, 3.0 in 2023) and Org mode have improved
support for automatic numbering of figures, tables and equations. 

The non-customisable and non-optional numbering of figures, tables and
the like has been removed from =ox-pandoc=. This is to avoid conflicts
with automatic labelling and numbering of these document elements in
=pandoc= and optional filters.

This is an incompatible change that alters output from existing
documents. If you require the old behaviour you may pin your =ox-pandoc=
version to one that included numbering of figures. The last tagged
version of =ox-pandoc= with numbering is *v2.0*, from January 2023. No
fixes or features will be ported to this version.

* History and People
  This package was inspired by [[https://github.com/robtillotson/org-pandoc][org-pandoc]], but was entirely re-written by [[http://github.com/kawabata][kawabata]] who is the original author of =ox-pandoc=. The code was released as a emacs package via MELPA.

  In 2021, the package was updated to address small feature requests, apply patches and fix a number of bugs, most of which had arisen through changes in =pandoc= itself. The package is currently maintained by  [[http://github.com/a-fent][a-fent]].
